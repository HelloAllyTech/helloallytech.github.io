# Get Started

Ready to contribute? Here's how to get set up:

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the infrastructure repo** (easiest way to get everything):
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:HelloAllyTech/infra.git
   cd infra
   ./bootstrap.sh
   ```
   This will clone and set up all Ally repositories for you!

2. **Choose your area of interest** and navigate to that repository

3. **Check out our [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.html)** for detailed setup instructions for each repo

- **Backend developers**: Explore [ally-be](https://github.com/HelloAllyTech/ally-be) for API development

- **DevOps engineers**: Start with [infra](https://github.com/HelloAllyTech/infra)

## How We Track Issues

We use GitHub Issues across all our repositories to track bugs, feature requests, and improvements. Here's how it works:

- **Repository-specific issues**: Each repo has its own issue tracker for problems specific to that codebase
- **Labels**: We use labels like `bug`, `enhancement`, `good first issue`, `help wanted`, etc.
- **Good First Issues**: Look for the `good first issue` label to find beginner-friendly tasks
- **Milestones**: We organize work into milestones for better project planning

### Finding issues to work on:
1. Browse issues in the repository you're interested in
2. Look for `good first issue` or `help wanted` labels
3. Check if someone is already assigned
4. Comment on the issue to express interest before starting work

## Development Environment

Each repository has its own setup instructions, but here are the common requirements:

### General Requirements
- Git
- Docker and Docker Compose (recommended via Colima on macOS)
- Your preferred code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Repository-Specific Setup
