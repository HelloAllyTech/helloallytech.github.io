# Working with the Stacks MCP

**Stacks** is a retrieval service (RAG) that holds product-management and engineering-practice
guidance, exposed to Claude Code and other agents over MCP. It is wired into every Ally repo, so
the guidance is available at the moment a decision is being made rather than in review, when
re-deciding is expensive.

## The rule

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Whenever a decision about how the product should behave comes up, search Stacks, incorporate
> relevant returned guidance, and cite chunk titles. An agent does this for itself — you do not
> have to fetch context on its behalf. Planning is the most important moment, not the only one.**

Concretely, that means:

| Moment | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| **Before writing an implementation plan** — a plan-mode plan, design doc, spec, or written breakdown before the first commit | The original rule. Guidance that arrives after the plan is a citation exercise |
| **While implementing**, at each point you would otherwise invent the answer: an empty, loading, edge or failure state; a user-facing label, button or error message; what a view shows and what it omits; a threshold, limit, cadence or reward rule | Where most product decisions are actually made, and where the corpus went unused before 2026-08-10 |
| **While reviewing**, for how a change behaves rather than how it reads | Cheaper than re-deciding after merge |

Trivial mechanical work (a rename, a dependency bump, a typo fix) does not need it.

> [!NOTE]
> Until 2026-08-10 this rule — and the MCP server's own tool descriptions — said *planning* only.
> That wording was load-bearing in a way that was easy to miss: a connected session reads the tool

## How you reach it

Four surfaces. Three are tools an agent calls for itself; one is a prompt only you can invoke:

| Surface | Type | Who invokes it |
|---|---|---|
| `search_chunks` | tool — `query`, optional `max_results` (1–10, default 4) and `tags` | the agent |
| `get_chunks` | tool — `ids` (1–20) from a search result or a returned block | the agent |
| `list_tags` | tool — no arguments | the agent |
| `/stacks:planning_context` | MCP **prompt**, one argument `task_description` | you, in chat |

The split is the thing to hold on to. **An agent reaches the library on its own initiative, at the
moment a judgement actually comes up** — which is usually mid-implementation, long after any
planning step. The prompt is the *human* entry point, for when you want the context in front of
you rather than in a session's working memory; it takes a whole task description and returns full
chunk bodies.

> [!NOTE]
> For a few hours on 2026-08-10 the server was narrowed to just `get_chunks` and the prompt, and

> stale; this table is current.

One habit survived the reversal, because it was always true for a different reason:

- **Don't let a session claim Stacks does or doesn't cover something.** `list_tags` shows how the
  library is organised, not what it contains, and a search returning nothing is not evidence of a
  gap. The most a session can honestly say is what a particular result set did or didn't contain.
  A confident "Stacks has nothing on empty states" is not a checkable claim.

## Getting the context

Describe the task, not a search phrase. The argument is a task description and the server runs one
hybrid search over it:

```
/stacks:planning_context rolling out a database migration that changes voice config for live sessions
```

| Task | A description that works |
|---|---|
| A learner-facing streak widget | `adding a streak counter to the learner home screen — what cadence, what reward, what it shows on a broken streak` |
| A new analytics chart on the admin console | `a new chart on the admin analytics console showing per-cohort practice minutes, including small-sample cohorts` |
| Splitting a service in two | `splitting the session service in two, migrating incrementally without downtime` |

`"scenario_voices table migration"` retrieves nothing useful; the sentence above it retrieves the
guidance that matters. Minimum three characters.

**Read the results before you decide, not after.** The point is that returned guidance changes
the outcome — which slice ships first, which states the UI needs, what the non-goals are. Context
that arrives after the decision is a citation exercise.

**Judge relevance yourself.** Both surfaces always return their top-ranked matches whether or not
they fit — there is no relevance floor and no "nothing found" response. The prompt returns eight
chunks; `search_chunks` returns four by default. A result set full of off-topic chunks is a normal
outcome, not a signal to force a fit.

**An agent's queries look different from yours.** `search_chunks` wants a specific noun phrase
(`"empty state design patterns"`); the prompt wants the whole task description above. Both are
right — the prompt runs one search over whatever you typed, while an agent can afford several
sharp queries. Search results come back compact — title, section, tags, a relevance score, an id
and one framing sentence — so that searching often is cheap.

Note what a hit does *not* carry: there is no title or author of the material a chunk was distilled
from, anywhere in the API. Attribution stops at the section. That is deliberate — a chunk is the
team's own distilled principle, to be weighed on whether it fits the decision in front of you, not
a reference to go and look up.

> [!NOTE]
> **How many queries, and what `max_results`, keeps moving as the corpus changes — treat both as
> knobs to turn up, not fixed numbers.** "Two to four queries at the default `max_results` of 4"
> was right when chunks were long paragraphs. Chunks were restructured (2026-08-13) into short,
> title-as-principle entries (e.g. *"Design autonomy sliders to build user trust"*) — each one
> carries less, so getting equivalent coverage of a topic now means **both** a higher
> `max_results` per call (8 rather than 4) **and** more distinct queries per task (beyond the old
> 2–4), covering more of the task's distinct aspects rather than the same handful more deeply.
> Searching is cheap; err toward more of both rather than defaulting back to the old numbers.

> [!NOTE]
> **Corpus composition is an active moving target — new material is still being added.** A characterization
> of what the library covers from any one session (including this page, if it starts to read that
> way) is a snapshot, not a scoping fact. Don't skip a query because "Stacks doesn't have anything
> on that" based on a past session's results — re-check `list_tags` or just run the query again.
> This is the same discipline as the relevance rule above, applied to your own prior observations,
> not just to claims about gaps.

`get_chunks` fetches the verbatim source excerpt behind a chunk, plus its section and source
summaries, when the exact wording matters. It takes ids from a search result or a returned block;
invented ids will not resolve. The source summary is repeated verbatim on every chunk drawn from
the same source — batching several ids from one source in a single call spends real tokens on
duplicated text, worth knowing before requesting many at once.

## Citing what you use

Name the **chunk title** inline where the guidance shapes a decision, so a reviewer can trace it:

```markdown
## Plan

3. Ship the streak counter read-only in v1; no notifications until we have retention data.
   (Stacks: *Gamification — Extrinsic Rewards and Motivation Crowding*)
```

Cite only chunks you actually applied. If a block came back with nothing relevant, say so in one
line — "Stacks context retrieved — nothing applicable" — and move on. A silent skip and a genuine
miss look identical to a reviewer. If no block was retrieved at all, say *that* instead; "nothing
applicable" and "never looked" are different claims and only one of them is checkable.

## Stacks replaced the in-wiki product practices

Until 2026-08-07 this wiki carried its own **Product Management Best Practices** section — a hub
plus seven pages of house rules, written from decisions this team had made. That section is
**deprecated**; Stacks is now where product guidance comes from, and judgement calls made during
a task go into the Stacks corpus rather than back into `wiki/product/`.

The old pages are still readable and still linked. Treat them as **history, not rules**:

- Nothing in them is a gate any more — including the Data Visualisation checklist, which used to
  be enforced as one.
- Where they contradict current Stacks guidance, Stacks wins.
- They are not deleted because several platform pages cite their principles by number
  ([Analytics Agent](../platform/analytics-agent.md) references *Data Visualisation* 13 and
  27–28 and *UI & Interaction* 4–5), and because they record why Ally works the way it does —
  which is context a general corpus does not have.

That last point is worth being deliberate about. The deprecated pages hold Ally-specific
findings — Carbon's chart-overflow behaviour, the `roles[]`-vs-collapsed-`role` gating trap, the
minimum-group-size rule for tenant-isolated metrics — that a general product-management corpus
has no reason to contain. **If a block comes back with nothing for one of those, check the
deprecated page before re-deriving it.** Anything you find there that is still
true and still load-bearing belongs in Stacks; putting it back into the wiki is not the path any
more.

## Configuration

Every Ally repo commits four things at its root, so a session is wired up the moment it starts
and nobody has to add or invoke anything by hand:

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `.mcp.json` | Declares the `stacks` server. It carries **no endpoint and no credential** — all it does is exec the bridge below |
| `.claude/stacks-bridge.mjs` | A stdio→HTTP proxy that resolves a key at startup, which is why there is nothing to set up — see **Why a bridge** below |
| `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` | State the rule above, so it is in context from the first turn |
| `.claude/skills/stacks/SKILL.md` | A skill whose description names the trigger moments. Its one-line description sits in context every turn at negligible cost, so the rule keeps re-asserting itself deep into a long session, where a `CLAUDE.md` line read at startup has long since stopped competing for attention |

**The `UserPromptSubmit` hook was retired on 2026-08-10.** Every repo used to commit
`.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/hooks/stacks-search.sh`, a keyword-gated hook that pulled a
small context block when a prompt *looked* product-shaped. It existed only because an agent could
not search for itself; once `search_chunks` came back it was redundant, and keeping it would have
meant two paths spending the same quota on overlapping queries.

It is worth knowing why a phrase gate was never good enough, because the same trap applies to any
replacement: it fired on the *prompt text*, so it could not reach the library mid-implementation
when no new prompt had arrived — which is exactly where most product decisions get made. Its regex
also both over- and under-matched ("what happens when the list is empty" did not match; `empty
state` was needed verbatim). And it failed open and silent by design, so a session that got no
context looked identical to one where the library had nothing.

That last property is the one to carry forward: **silence is not evidence the library was
consulted.** Ask what was searched and what was cited.

### Why a bridge

`.mcp.json` can expand `${ENV_VAR}` but cannot run a command, so an HTTP server declaration can
only carry a credential that *already exists* in the environment. That left two ways to reach
zero-setup: commit a key — impossible, four of the seven Ally repos are public — or run a process
that can **obtain** one. The bridge is that process. It speaks MCP over stdio to Claude Code and
forwards each message to the HTTP endpoint, using a key it resolves once at startup, in three
tiers:

| | Tier | Why it exists |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `STACKS_API_KEY` in the environment | An engineer who already set one keeps working, and CI can inject one without touching GitHub |
| 2 | `~/.claude/.stacks-key` — the cache, mode `0600` | Short-circuits tier 3 |
| 3 | `gh auth token` → `POST /api/mcp/exchange` | The server verifies HelloAllyTech org membership, drops the GitHub token, and returns a key the bridge caches |

Because tier 2 short-circuits, tier 3 runs **once per machine**, not once per session — and on any
machine that has run a session before, **tier 2 is what actually serves.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Setup is zero: `gh auth login` once per machine is the whole story.** There is no key to
> request, export, or rotate by hand, and none is ever committed. An unset `STACKS_API_KEY` is the
> normal state on a working machine — **do not read it as a broken setup.**

**The bridge fails loud, and that is the point.** The hook it replaced failed open and silent, so a
session that got no context looked identical to a library with nothing to say. A bridge cannot do
that: with no key there is no server at all, and it exits with a message naming the fix.

**Its copies have no sync mechanism.** Nine files in all — the canonical
`clients/stacks-bridge.mjs` in the Stacks server repo, plus eight deployed copies (the `ally-code`
workspace root and the seven Ally repos). Nothing fails loudly when one drifts, so **diff the
copies before blaming the server.**

**One-time setup per engineer:**

1. `gh auth login`, once per machine, as an account in the **HelloAllyTech** org.
2. Start a fresh agent session in any Ally repo and approve the `stacks` server when prompted —
   project-scoped MCP servers require approval once per project.

That is the whole of it. The first session on a machine exchanges your GitHub token for a key and
caches it; every session after that reads the cache.

**Checking it works** — ask the session to list the Stacks tools. `search_chunks`, `get_chunks` and
`list_tags` should all be there, alongside `/stacks:planning_context` as a slash command. A session
offering only `get_chunks` is talking to a stale deployment.

**If it is missing or every call fails, the bridge has already said why — read its stderr before
guessing.** Every failure path names its own fix:

| Message on stderr | What it means |
|---|---|
| `No Stacks key and no GitHub login to derive one from` | Tier 3 had nothing to work with — run `gh auth login` |
| `Stacks refused to issue a key (…)` | `gh` is authenticated as someone outside the HelloAllyTech org |
| `Stacks rejected the cached key (401)` | The cached key was revoked or rotated — `rm ~/.claude/.stacks-key`, then start a new session |
| `Could not reach the Stacks server…` | Network, or the endpoint is down. Nothing local to fix |

Restart the session after any of these — the key and `.mcp.json` are both resolved at startup.
Diagnosing this by checking `$STACKS_API_KEY` will mislead you: it is one tier of three, and on a
healthy machine it is normally unset.

If a search returns an authorization error, it is the key; if it returns a rate-limit message,
retry. Neither means the corpus is empty.

Do not work around a broken Stacks connection by skipping the library silently. Fix it, or say in
the plan that Stacks was unavailable.
