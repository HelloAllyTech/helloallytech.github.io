# ally-mobile — Mobile App

## Purpose

`ally-mobile` is the React Native app that counsellors use in the field. It supports three core workflows: joining and listening to live counselling sessions with real-time transcription and AI-assisted call summaries; reviewing and commenting on session/simulation transcripts (peer review); and running voice-based AI training simulations against a simulated client. Newer areas add Scribe voice-dictation notes, review read/unread management, simulation pause/resume, a first-login complete-profile gate, and multilingual (i18n) content parity. The app talks to `ally-be` over REST and Socket.IO, and to LiveKit rooms driven by `ally-ai-learn` for simulations.

## Architecture & Feature Areas

Standard React Native layout under `src/`: `screens/`, `components/`, `services/` (RTK Query APIs), `store/` (slices), `hooks/`, `navigation/`, `localization/`, `constants/`, `types/`, `theme/`, `utils/`, `contexts/`.

Navigation is driven by `RootNavigator.tsx`, which switches the stack on `isAuthenticated`. The authenticated stack mounts a `DrawerNavigator` (which contains the tab navigator) plus stack screens for listening, call summary, simulations, reviews, and the complete-profile gate.

**Live sessions & audio streaming.** `ListeningScreen` handles the active session. Audio is captured via `useLiveAudioStream` and streamed over Socket.IO. `RootNavigator` opens two socket connections through `useSocketConnection` — one on the microphone namespace and one on the cloud-telephony namespace — and reacts to `USER_JOINED` events (via `useCounselorChat` / `useNavigationAwareCounselorChat`) to route the counsellor into the live `ListeningScreen`. `useSocketConnection` buffers frames across a transient app background and flushes on resume.

**Transcription & summaries.** After a call, `CallSummaryScreen` shows the AI summary and transcript, backed by `callSummaryApi`, `callTranscriptApi`, and `settingsApi` (summary field definitions fetched via `useLazyGetSummaryFieldsQuery`). `CallLogScreen` lists past calls. Deep links to a specific call summary are resolved in `RootNavigator` using `utils/deeplink` (`getCallIdFromUrl`, `isSupportedDeepLink`, `navigateToCallSummaryOrLog`).

**Reviews (incl. read/unread management).** Peer review lives in `ReviewScreen`, `ReviewDetailsScreen`, and `ShareForReviewScreen`, plus a parallel Scribe review flow (`ScribeReviewDetailsScreen`) served by `scribeReviewsApi` / `scribeReviewThreadsApi` / `scribeGeneralCommentsApi` / `scribeReactionsApi`. `reviewsApi.ts` provides threaded comments, general comments, comment visibility/edit/delete, and review status updates. Read/unread management is explicit: `getReviews` accepts `sortBy` and `readFilter` params, `markSimulationReviewAsRead` (PATCH) marks a review read, and `getUnreadSimulationReviewCount` feeds an unread badge (cached under the `UnreadReviewCount` tag). A `ReviewApiContext` (`src/contexts/`) lets shared review components target either the standard or Scribe API set. Hooks: `useReviews`, `useToggleReviewPrivacy`, `useHideReviewDetails`, `useReactions`, `usePaginatedComments`, `useCommentActions`.

**Simulations (incl. pause/resume).** Simulation browsing and detail screens (`SimulationsScreen`, `SimulationDetailsScreen`, `SimulationPathDetailsScreen`, `CaseDetailsScreen`) run off `simulationsApi.ts`, which covers scenarios, scenario paths, cases, sessions, upcoming-scenario polling, event checklists, skills, and credits. The live voice session is `SimulationAssistantScreen`, which connects to a LiveKit `Room` (`@livekit/react-native` + `livekit-client`) with an agent served by `ally-ai-learn`. Pause/resume is implemented over a LiveKit control channel: the client sends `pause`/`resume` and the agent acks with `paused`/`resumed` (with an ack timeout fallback). Paused spans are excluded from the displayed timer and scenario time limit via an accumulated `pausedOffsetMs`; authoritative billing/leaderboard paused time is tracked server-side (`scenario_sessions.totalPausedMs`). Session transitions across path/case flows are orchestrated by `useSimulationTransition` (polling for the next scenario, retry, 429 retry modal), with supporting hooks `useStartSimulation`, `useSimulationCredits`, `useSimulationTranscriptDetails`, and `useSimulationSessionRecordingUrl`. Post-session feedback is captured in `SimulationFeedbackScreen`.

**Scribe notes with voice dictation.** `scribeNoteApi.ts` creates manual Scribe notes (an empty DICTATION chat), transcribes dictated audio, and extracts structured field values. `generateNoteFromAudio` uploads the recorded WAV as multipart/form-data (`audio`, a JSON `fields` spec, optional `languageHint`); the audio is processed server-side in memory and never stored. The dictation transcript is persisted separately via `saveNoteTranscript` so it appears in the note's Transcript view. Recording is handled by `useVoiceNoteRecorder` (idle/recording/paused/stopped with start/pause/resume/stop and elapsed-time tracking that excludes paused spans). The UI lives in `CallSummaryScreen/components/VoiceNotePanel/` (`VoiceNotePanel`, `VoiceNoteSection`). Availability is gated by two permission-guarded settings hooks: `useScribeNoteCreationEnabled` and `useScribeVoiceNoteEnabled` (both skip their request unless the user holds `COUNSELOR_ACCESS`; the backend also enforces the per-tenant toggle and returns 403 otherwise).

**Complete-profile gate.** Accounts created in bulk by an admin have no name on first login. `SplashScreen` checks `userData.profileCompleted === false` and redirects to `CompleteProfileScreen` (mounted with gestures disabled). Submitting `useCompleteProfileMutation` (`authApi`) flips `profileCompleted` server-side and re-runs auth routing.

**Auth.** `authApi.ts` supports OTP (`generateOtp` / `verifyOtp`, versioned to v2), Google Sign-In (`useGoogleLogin`), and Apple Sign-In (`useAppleLogin`), with token refresh handled centrally in `services/api.ts` (`baseQueryWithReauth` retries once on 401 using the stored refresh token, else logs out). Tokens live in AsyncStorage; user/permission state is in `userSlice`.

**Analytics & gamification.** `UserAnalyticsScreen`, `AchievementsScreen`, `LeaderboardScreen`, `CommunityScreen`, and `ReactionsScreen` are backed by `analyticsApi`, `badgesApi`, `leaderboardApi`, and `reactionsApi`. Weekly leaderboard reminders are scheduled through `notificationService` + `@notifee/react-native`, gated on the `VIEW_COMMUNITY_LEADERBOARD` permission.

**i18n / language-code injection.** Localization is in `src/localization/` (`i18n.ts`, `dynamic.ts`, and `locales/` bundles for `en`, `hi`, `kn`, `mr`, `ta`). For content endpoints that return backend-generated user-facing text, `services/api.ts` injects the active UI language into the request: the allowlist in `languageCodeEndpoints.ts` (`LANGUAGE_CODE_ENDPOINTS`) drives a `baseQuery` that adds a bare ISO `languageCode` (from `i18n.resolvedLanguage`) into GET params or mutation bodies, so the server returns localized scenarios, cases, reviews, badges, leaderboard, etc. Auth/OTP/upload endpoints are intentionally excluded. An in-app language selector (drawer) plus dynamic remote translations are gated by `LANGUAGE_SELECTOR_FLAG` / `I18N_BASE_URL`. Hooks: `useLanguageDropdown`, `useTranslate`.

## Integration Points

- **ally-be (REST):** base URL is `API_BASE_URL + /api/` with a `v1`/`v2` version prefix chosen per-endpoint in `services/api.ts`. All feature APIs are RTK Query slices injected into a single `api` instance.
- **ally-be (Socket.IO):** two namespaces consumed from env — `/microphone-chat` (`MICROPHONE_SOCKET_PATH`) for in-app microphone streaming and `/cloud-telephony-chat` (`CLOUD_TELEPHONY_PATH`) for conference/telephony audio.
- **LiveKit / ally-ai-learn:** `SimulationAssistantScreen` joins a LiveKit `Room` for the voice simulation; the conversational agent (with pause/resume acks) is served by `ally-ai-learn`.
- **ally-web (deep linking):** `ALLY_WEB_URL` is used for sharing/deep links; inbound call-summary deep links are parsed and routed in `RootNavigator`.
- **Required env vars** (`env/.env.example`, typed in `src/config/env.ts`): `ENVIRONMENT`, `API_BASE_URL`, `API_VERSION`, `ALLY_WEB_URL`, `MICROPHONE_SOCKET_PATH`, `CLOUD_TELEPHONY_PATH`, `GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID`, `NOTIFICATION_SCHEDULE_DAY` / `_HOUR` / `_MINUTE`, `LANGUAGE_SELECTOR_FLAG`, `I18N_BASE_URL`. Most are asserted required at startup.
