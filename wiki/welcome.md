# Welcome to the Ally Developer Wiki

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This wiki is **public** (served at tech.helloally.ai). It must never contain secrets, credentials, IP addresses, internal hostnames, or cloud region details. Updates are made by developers and AI agents with commit/PR rights to this repo.

This is the canonical, sanitized documentation for **Ally** — a HIPAA-compliant platform for training mental health counselors through AI simulations, real-time session analysis, and peer review. It compiles architecture, SDLC rules, deployment, and environment knowledge across all Ally repositories.

## 📖 What is LLMWiki?

LLMWiki is a zero-compilation, static Markdown knowledge base. **AI agents** interact directly with the raw Markdown files; **humans** view them through this browser dashboard. The wiki is a compounding, persistent memory bank that gets richer with every source ingested.

## 🤖 AI Agent Setup Prompt

Paste this into your AI coding assistant (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor, etc.) to bootstrap it against this wiki:

```markdown
You are an AI assistant helping maintain the Ally Developer Wiki in this repository.
The wiki content root is at `/wiki/`. The `/llmwiki/` folder is the HTML rendering
engine — NEVER modify it (it lives at https://github.com/ajeygore/llmwiki).

This wiki is PUBLIC. Never write secrets, credentials, IP addresses, internal
hostnames/domains, or cloud region details into any page.

Read `agents.md` at the repo root, then follow its Ingestion, Query, and Lint flows:
1. Keep long-term learnings in `wiki/memory.md`.
2. Update `wiki/overview.md` when files/folders change.
3. Persist session progress in `wiki/context.md`.
4. Catalog every new page in `wiki/index.md` and log changes in `wiki/log.md`.
5. Keep pages cross-linked and consistent with the repos they describe.
```
