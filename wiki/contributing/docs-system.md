# Documentation System

This page documents the machinery that keeps Ally's docs findable and current. If you are
just trying to *write* something, you probably want the [Contributing Guide](guide.md) instead.

The system optimises for five things, in this order:

1. An AI coding session finds the right context **fast**.
2. The context it finds is **relevant and complete**.
3. It does **not** load context it didn't need.
4. Docs get **updated** as a side effect of shipping code, not as an act of virtue.
5. Every fact has **one home**.

---

## 1. The layers

| Layer | Lives in | Size budget | Loaded |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` | each code repo, root | ≤ 120 lines | always, automatically |
| `WIKI-ROUTING.md` | each code repo, generated | ≤ 1,000 tokens | always, automatically |
| Repo-local deep docs | each code repo (`docs/`, `DATA_SCHEMA.md`) | unbounded | on demand |
| The wiki | `helloallytech.github.io` | unbounded | on demand, over HTTP |

The rule that makes this work: **the always-loaded layers contain routing and invariants;
everything with a size or a shelf-life lives in the on-demand layers.**

`AGENTS.md` is a *router*, not a summary. It answers "given what I am about to do, what
should I read?" — and nothing else. It never restates a convention that has a canonical
home; it links to it.

`CLAUDE.md` is a byte-identical copy of `AGENTS.md`, kept in step by CI (see §3). Two files
exist only because different tools look for different names.

---

## 2. `.docs-map.yml` — which docs cover which code

Every code repo has one at its root. It is the single declaration of doc↔code ownership,
and three separate systems read it: the CI guard, the weekly reconciler, and humans trying
to work out what they broke.

```yaml
version: 1
repo: ally-be

rules:
  - id: data-schema
    watch:
      - "src/**/entity/*.entity.ts"
    requires: DATA_SCHEMA.md
    why: >
      Why this doc must move when this code moves.
```

**`watch`** — glob patterns, matched against the PR's changed files.

**`requires`** — what must also change. One of:

| Form | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `path/to/doc.md` | a file in this repo; the PR must touch it |
| `wiki:platform/architecture.md` | a page in the wiki repo; the PR body must carry a `Wiki-PR:` trailer |
| `any_of: [a.md, b.md]` | at least one of these |
| `mirror` | the watched files must be byte-identical to each other |
| `none` | watched, but no doc required (documents a deliberate decision) |

**`why`** — one sentence. Required. A rule nobody can justify is a rule that will be
skipped forever, and the text is what the CI failure message shows.

### Escape hatches

Two, both deliberate and both visible in the PR record:

- The **`docs:skip` label** — for changes where the doc genuinely doesn't move.
- A **`Wiki-PR: none — <reason>`** trailer in the PR body — same, but leaves the reason in
  the commit history.

Heavy use of either is a signal the rule is wrong. Fix the rule; don't normalise the bypass.

---

## 3. CI: the docs guard

One reusable workflow lives in `helloallytech/.github` and every code repo calls it in ~10
lines. It runs on every PR and:

1. Reads `.docs-map.yml`.
2. Matches changed files against each rule's `watch` globs.
3. Fails if a matched rule's `requires` is unsatisfied — unless an escape hatch applies.
4. Asserts `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` are identical.
5. Checks `AGENTS.md` is within its line budget.

The failure message names the rule, quotes its `why`, and prints the exact command to fix
it. A guard that only says "docs check failed" trains people to reach for the label.

---

## 4. Updating the wiki from a code repo

Wiki edits used to need a second, hand-rolled PR in a second repo. That friction — not
forgetfulness — is why four platform pages sat unchanged for a month while the code moved
daily. The path is now one command:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/helloallytech/helloallytech.github.io .wiki-tmp
# edit .wiki-tmp/wiki/**
.wiki-tmp/scripts/wiki-pr.sh "<url of your code PR>"   # PR flow
.wiki-tmp/scripts/wiki-pr.sh HEAD                      # trunk-based: the commit you pushed
```

`.wiki-tmp/` is gitignored in every code repo, so nothing leaks into the code branch. The
script branches, commits, pushes, and opens a **draft** wiki PR stamped with a `Source:`
trailer.

**Both source kinds are first-class**, because most changes here go straight to the default
branch rather than through a PR:

| Source | Trailer | What you do next |
|---|---|---|
| a code PR | `Source: …/pull/<n>` | paste the printed `Wiki-PR:` line into the PR body — that is what satisfies the guard in §3 |
| a commit | `Source: …/commit/<sha>` | nothing; a direct push has no description to carry a trailer |

The script commits under **your** git identity, inherited from the code repo you ran it
from. If it cannot find one it stops rather than substituting a placeholder — documentation
should count as its author's contribution.

### Lifecycle coupling

A workflow in the wiki repo reads the `Source:` trailer and keeps the wiki PR in step with
whatever spawned it:

- source PR **merges**, or source commit **reaches the default branch** → wiki PR marked
  ready and merged
- source PR **closes unmerged** → wiki PR closed
- source **pending > 7 days** → nudge (on both PRs; a commit has nothing to nudge, so the
  wiki PR alone)

So docs land in the same beat as the code, instead of drifting into a stale open PR. A wiki
PR with no `Source:` trailer at all is left alone — which also means it will never be marked
ready, so hand-written wiki PRs must be merged by hand.

---

## 5. The reconciler

§3 and §4 only fire when someone touches watched code. Pages that describe the platform
in general have no such trigger and drift silently — which is exactly what happened to
`tech-stack.md`, `dev-setup.md` and `repos/infra.md`.

So a scheduled job runs weekly in the wiki repo, walks every page carrying
`last_reconciled` frontmatter, verifies its claims against the current code, and opens
**one** PR with corrections plus a stamp bump. Pages it cannot verify get an issue instead.

It opens PRs. It never pushes to `main`.

---

## 6. Facts that go stale by construction

Counts belong in generated output, not prose. `wiki/platform/stats.md` is regenerated by the
reconciler; prose should state invariants that survive a refactor:

> ✅ "Every ally-be entity carries a `tenantId`; queries must respect tenant isolation."
> ❌ "ally-be has 43 modules and 211+ migrations."

If you catch yourself typing a number that a script could count, put it in `platform/stats.md`
and link to it.

---

## 7. Adding to the system

**A new doc that must not go stale** → add a rule to the relevant `.docs-map.yml`, with a `why`.

**A new wiki page** → add frontmatter (`title`, `tags`, `summary`, `last_reconciled`),
register it in [`index.md`](../index.md), log it in [`log.md`](../log.md). `ROUTING.md` and
`manifest.json` regenerate themselves from the frontmatter — do not hand-edit either.

**A new convention** → put it in exactly one place and link to it from the others. If you
find the same rule written twice, that is a bug: the copies will disagree, and an agent
reading both will pay tokens to arrive at ambiguity.
