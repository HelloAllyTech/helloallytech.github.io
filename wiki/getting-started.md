# Getting Started

This guide explains how to use and operate the Ally Developer Wiki.

> **Content policy (public site):** This wiki is served publicly at tech.helloally.ai. Document architecture, SDLC rules, deployment, and environment *concepts* — but **never** commit secrets, credentials, IP addresses, internal hostnames/domains, or cloud region details.

## For Humans
- Browse online at **https://tech.helloally.ai**, or serve locally with `./llmwiki/run` from the repo root and open the printed `http://localhost:PORT`.
- Use the sidebar filter and the header search to find pages, tags, and content.
- Read the [Platform Overview](platform/overview.md) first, then dive into the [repo pages](index.md#repositories).

## For AI Agents
- Treat `/wiki/` as the permanent knowledge source; the engine in `/llmwiki/` is **read-only**.
- Follow the Ingestion, Query, and Lint flows in `agents.md` at the repo root.
- When ingesting: write the summary page under the right `wiki/` subfolder (`platform/`, `repos/`, `contributing/`, …), cross-link it, add it to `wiki/index.md`, and append an entry to `wiki/log.md`.
- Record durable learnings in `wiki/memory.md` and session state in `wiki/context.md`.
- Apply the content policy above to every edit.

## Deploying
This repo is a GitHub Pages site. `.nojekyll` disables Jekyll so the client-side viewer can fetch raw `.md` files. Pushing to the default branch publishes to **tech.helloally.ai** (the `CNAME`).
